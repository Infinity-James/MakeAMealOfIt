## Make A Meal Of It

Make a Meal Of It is an app that is to be used by anybody who wants to find a recipe in as specific or general a manner as they wish. It uses the Yummly database to access over a million recipes, and filters the results cleverly to provide the user with a recipe that suits their needs.

# Why Open Source It?

The app works at a level where I would be happy to have people using it on a dailt basis. It was on the App Store for a period of a few months until the server costs were at a point where it was not worth it to me to keep it available. The people who had bought it could keep it, and still use it, but I removed it so that it was no longer available to be purchased. 

I had made the app with the intention of helping people with specific dietary requirements, as well as with the goal to get a full time job. After getting a permanent position at a good company I felt it best to remove the app and now I would like to give the code to anybody who may find it helpful.

# Quality of Code

The code is certainly not a good reflection of my own standards at this point in time. I began development a year ago, and a lot has changed since then. In the source you will find questionable decisions when it comes to the responsibility of certain classes, odd naming of classes, and a few rather long and convoluted methods.

As I say, I need to point out that I am aware of 99% of the places where I went wrong in creating this app.
